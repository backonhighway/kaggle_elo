do batch_num agg and concat
run predictions

predict every pred_col from test->train
predict every pred_col from train->test

make two models separated with data of extragal, gal

predict by using models from bare time series

use nn
do pseudo-labeling

use clustering from test, then label train with it

make model to detect whether a row is train or test
-> use it for labeling class99

Do batch agg with different batch len
show batch length for it

rewrite submodel

in a batch, the 30-70percentile has a max diff of mjd
how much time does it take to recover to normalcy

need to take the beginning and end
